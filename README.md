## 🤖 AI Use Declaration

While the initial HTML boilerplate was written manually, AI tools played a supporting role in generating content, structuring sections, and providing development guidance. Google Gemini was used for code suggestions and troubleshooting, and ChatGPT assisted with written content refinement and documentation. AI helped streamline the workflow and allowed more focus on design and user experience. All final code implementation and project decisions were made by the project author.
